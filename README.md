Mobile Page Framework
=================
The idea of MPF is to function as a simple framework that will facilitate the creation of Screens or Views to mobile devices. Right now there are frame works such as JQM, Sencha, and LungoJS, but all of these applications include too many features that a developer might not want and will therefore slowdown the application.
Right now the application relies on Jquery and a  jquery plugin called jquery.transit. In future developments I will try to implement a vanilla JS solution or one that uses XUI, and maybe a lighter transitions option.
